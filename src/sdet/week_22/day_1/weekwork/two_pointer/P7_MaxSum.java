/*
Given an array nums of integers and integer k, return the maximum sum such that there exists i < j with nums[i] + nums[j] = sum and sum < k. If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], k = 60
Output: 58
Explanation: We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
