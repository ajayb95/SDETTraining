/*
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
Example 1:

Input: s = "hardwork", wordDict = ["hard", "work"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "hardwork" can be segmented as "hard work".

Example 2:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
