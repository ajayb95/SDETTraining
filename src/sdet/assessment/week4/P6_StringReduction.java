/*
Given a string, reduce it in such a way that all of its substrings are
distinct. To do so, you may delete any characters at any index. What is
the minimum number of deletions needed?
Note: A substring is a contiguous group of 1 or more characters within
a string.

Example
s = "abab"
Substrings in s are { 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'ab', 'ba', 'ab', 'aba', 'bab', 'abab'}. By
deleting one "a" and one "b", the string becomes "ab" or "ba" and all of
its substrings are distinct. This required 2 deletions.
