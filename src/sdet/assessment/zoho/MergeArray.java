/*
You are given 2 sorted int array A and B. The sort order can be asc or des. write a prgm to create an array C that contains int from A and B. C is in asc order and has no dup.
Note: Removal of dup and ordering has to be done while adding elements to C. i.e. don't write separate loops to sort and remove dups.

E.g.:
Input: [3,6,9],[8,7,5]
Output: [3,5,6,7,8,9]
Input: [9,9,6,3],[5,7,8,9]
Output: [3,5,6,7,8,9]
Input: [9,6],[5,17,21]
Output: [5,6,9,17,21]
