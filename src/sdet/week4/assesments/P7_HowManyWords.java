/*
A sentence is made up of a group of words. Each word is a sequence of
letters, ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z'), that may contain one or more hyphens and may
end in a punctuation mark: period (.), comma (,), question mark (?), or
exclamation point (!). Words will be separated by one or more white
space characters. Hyphens join two words into one and should be
retained while the other punctuation marks should be stripped.
Determine the number of words in a given sentence.

Example
s = 'How many eggs are in a half-dozen, 13?'
The list of words in the string is ['How', 'many', 'eggs', 'are', in', 'a', 'halfdozen']
and the number of words is 7. Notice that the numeric string,
'13', is not a word because it is not within the allowed character set.
